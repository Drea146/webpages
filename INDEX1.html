<h1>The Road Not Taken</h1>
</center>
<div class="poem">
    <p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
    And sorry I could not travel both<br>
    And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
    And looked down one as far as I could</p>

    <p>To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br>
    Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
    And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
    Because it was grassy and wanted wear;</p>

    <p>Though as for that the passing there<br>
    Had worn them really about the same,<br>
    And both that morning equally lay<br>
    In leaves no step had trodden black.</p>

    <p>Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
    Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
    I doubted if I should ever come back.<br>
    I shall be telling this with a sigh</p>
